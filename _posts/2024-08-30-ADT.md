# Data and Data types
* A data is stored in a variable and each variable has a type.
* Some of the premitive data types include int, float, string etc.
* But sometimes we will be in the need of something more, like a complex data type.
* To represent real word entities we need something called objects. In object oriented programming languages like Java, Python etc. we use something called 'Class' and in C language we use something called 'structures'.

# Operations
* Each primitive data type will have its own plausible operations. Int cooperates with addition, subtraction etc.
* Likewise, ABT's like arrays will also have some set of plausible operations
* So, a concept(own data type) with its own operations and data is called an abstract data type.
